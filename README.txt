StudentApp - Multi-page demo (Login + 3 pages)

What you get
- login.html       (Sign in page)
- dashboard.html   (Landing / Dashboard)
- students.html    (Add / Edit / Delete student details)
- profile.html     (Update username/email)
- styles.css       (Shared styles)
- app.js           (Shared JavaScript for auth + students)
- README.txt       (this file)

How it works
- This is a client-side demo. Authentication is simulated using localStorage.
- Use username/password `demo/demo` for quick access, or any non-empty credentials.
- Student data is stored in browser localStorage (no server required).

To run
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open login.html in your browser.
3. Sign in and navigate between pages.
